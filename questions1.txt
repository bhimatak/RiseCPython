Q.12
Given an array A of N positive numbers. The task is to find the position 
where equilibrium first occurs in the array. Equilibrium position in an array is a position such that the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of   elements after it.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer, denoting the size of the array. 
The second line contains integers denoting the elements 
of the array.
Constraints
1<= n<=100
1<=arr<= 1000, where arr is the ith element of the array.

Output Format:
The output line contains integer denoting an equilibrium
index (if any) or -1 (if no equilibrium indexes exist).

Q16. Find a partition point in array

Given an unsorted array of integers. Find an element such that all the elements to its left are smaller and to its right are greater. Print -1 if no such element exists.

Note that there can be more than one such elements. For example an array which is sorted in increasing order all elements follow the property. We need to find only one such element.

Examples :

Input :  A[] = {4, 3, 2, 5, 8, 6, 7}  
Output : 5 

Input : A[] = {5, 6, 2, 8, 10, 9, 8} 
Output : -1
